TECH-A-THON

TECH-A-THON : is an event organised by ECESOC, BIT Mesra. It encourages students from colleges all over India to participate and compete in domain of ML/AI and Embedded Systems. TECH-A-THON is a whole process of first learning what you’re interested in through weekly tasks, doing interesting projects along the way and then competing with teams across India. 


VIRTUAL 'i' 

Virtual ‘i’ : acts as an eye of a blind person. We implement Object Recognition using CNN and then we use text to speech for what the camera will be recording (live) to be seen on the screen with a text box around it in which the object name would be written, and so from text to speech we can make the person hear what is in front of him. Along with this we can also add hand written text recognition which would give him freedom to read (like he can complete reading a book in audio format because of his stick) or rather listen to what is written without the help of any other person and thus he would be independent. 

Yolov3 made the initial contribution of framing the object detection problem as a two-step problem to first identify a bounding box (regression problem) and then identify that object’s class (classification problem).
We used CNN (Convolution Neural Network) for image classification. A convolution neural community is a neural community algorithm this is used in photo getting to know and photo class. A convolution layer performs a convolution operation for the given enter and passes the output to the subsequent layer. In well known, different neural network set of rules requires quite a few parameters and a whole lot of neurons due to very massive enter sizes related with pix. The Convolution Neural network allows in fixing this problem by means of permitting every layer to be deeper and also with very fewer range of parameters. From each cluster of neurons layer, the Pooling operation combines the output right into a unmarried neuron at the following layer. 

The platform used to put in force this project is Jupyter notebook, which uses python. The library used is Keras which permits faster and effective prototyping that runs over each CPU and GPU. TensorFlow runs over the keras background. TensorFlow is an open source library. It allows builders to create huge neural networks with many layers. TensorFlow is especially used for: classification, Prediction and introduction. 

The following video shows how our Handwritten Digit works:

Talking about the Object Detection, it can work in 2 ways firstly we can send a video and it will detect in that input video. Secondly it can detect using webcam i.e in live also it is detecting objects.

And here it is detecting object live using webcam ---

Accuracy : The Virtual 'i' is designed in such a way that it continuosly keeps displaying the probability (percentage) of it recognizing the object correctly. We personally feel that the accuracy of the system is quite good. It is very reliable. 

Usability : Not only can this object detection used for the welfare of blind people but it can also be helpful in drone technologies, for spying purposes during wartime as to locate where and what weapon is placed . We will just need to train the model for different types of weapon. Then this can also be used for tracking a person or a car in a crowded place, we just have to train models using pictures of different angles of the face of the person or the different angles of the car which need to be tracked in the crowded place.  

We intend to further work on it in future along with hardware to make it a complete and running model.
